# Crack Detection
## This project implements a rock image crack detection model utilizing Canny Edge Detection, capable of identifying cracks across a range of temperatures spanning, trained from room temperature to 500 degrees. Canny edge detection is a pivotal image processing technique that identifies edges within images through a multi-step algorithm. By employing Gaussian blurring, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, double thresholding, and edge tracking, it effectively highlights significant edges while reducing noise, making it a crucial tool in applications like object detection and image analysis.
## The model was trained using images of rocks taken in NITK Labs, and over a range of 25-500 degree celcius.
## A framework has been developed to predict temperatures of the rocks and its cracks based on the previously computed results of the crack detection.
## We have researched, studied and tested multiple algorithms for crack detection, and proved the direct relationship between crack length, intra-particular density and the temperature of the rock cracks.
